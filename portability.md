## Portability

Portability means money can be easily carried and transferred from one person to another, no matter where they are in the world. Bitcoin excels at this because it exists purely as digital data secured by cryptography. Unlike gold or cash, you don’t need physical space or worry about weight or bulk — you just need access to your private keys. This makes Bitcoin uniquely suited for the modern internet age, enabling near-instant, borderless transfers anywhere.

Bitcoin’s portability also empowers people who are unbanked or live in unstable regions. As long as they have a smartphone or computer with internet, they can safely store and send value without relying on traditional banks or governments. This universal accessibility expands financial freedom and inclusion globally, breaking down barriers that have historically kept people out of the monetary system.
