## Medium of Exchange

A medium of exchange is something widely accepted in trade for goods and services. Bitcoin serves this role by enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Its decentralized nature means anyone with an internet connection can send or receive Bitcoin globally, often faster and cheaper than traditional methods.

While Bitcoinâ€™s price volatility and transaction speeds have posed challenges, ongoing developments like the Lightning Network improve its usability as a day-to-day payment system. As more merchants and users adopt Bitcoin, its effectiveness as a medium of exchange continues to grow, expanding financial inclusion worldwide.
