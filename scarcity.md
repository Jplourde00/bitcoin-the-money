# Scarcity

One of Bitcoin’s most powerful traits is absolute scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed endlessly by central banks, Bitcoin has a hard-coded limit of 21 million coins — ever. This cap is enforced by the network’s consensus rules, meaning no one — not governments, not developers, not miners — can change it without global agreement. This makes Bitcoin the first form of money in human history with a mathematically fixed supply.

Scarcity is what gives Bitcoin its store-of-value strength. As more people demand Bitcoin while supply remains fixed, its value tends to rise. This is in sharp contrast to inflationary currencies, where printing new units devalues everyone's savings over time. Bitcoin’s predictable issuance schedule — halving every 210,000 blocks (~4 years) — mirrors the scarcity of commodities like gold but improves on it by being completely transparent, auditable, and programmable.
