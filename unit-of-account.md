## Unit of Account

A unit of account is a standard numerical unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and assets. While Bitcoin is gaining traction, it is not yet widely used as a unit of account because prices are mostly still quoted in fiat currencies like dollars or euros. This limits Bitcoin’s current use as a measure of value in everyday commerce.

However, as adoption grows and volatility decreases over time, Bitcoin’s potential to become a global unit of account increases. A future where goods and services are priced directly in Bitcoin would simplify transactions, reduce currency conversion costs, and reinforce Bitcoin’s role as a sovereign, borderless money!
