## Unit of Account

A unit of account is a standard numerical unit of measurement of the market value of goods, services, and assets. While Bitcoin is gaining traction, it is not yet widely adopted.

However, as adoption grows and volatility decreases over time, Bitcoinâ€™s potential to become a global unit of account increases. A future where goods and services are priced and exchanged in Bitcoin is possible.
