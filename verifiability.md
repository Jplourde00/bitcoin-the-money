## Verifiability

Verifiability means anyone can independently verify the authenticity and validity of money without relying on a trusted third party. Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain is a **public, transparent ledger** where every transaction is recorded and accessible to all. This openness allows anyone to audit the entire history of Bitcoin, ensuring that no coins are created out of thin air and no double-spending occurs.

This property is a game-changer compared to traditional money systems, which require trust in banks or governments to confirm balances and transactions. With Bitcoin, the rules are enforced by cryptography and consensus, giving users confidence that their money is genuine and the system is fair and secure.
