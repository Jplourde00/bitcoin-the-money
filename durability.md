## Durability

Durability means that money must withstand the test of time without degrading, decaying, or disappearing. Physical cash can tear, fade, or get lost, and even precious metals can corrode or be stolen. Bitcoin, however, exists as digital data secured by cryptographic proof and replicated across thousands of nodes worldwide. As long as the Bitcoin network runs, your coins are safe and unalterable, protected from physical wear or loss.

This digital durability makes Bitcoin a reliable store of value for generations to come. Unlike traditional money or commodities, Bitcoin’s existence does not depend on any single entity or physical object. Its decentralized design ensures that even if some nodes go offline, countless others keep the ledger intact and verifiable — preserving your ownership indefinitely.
