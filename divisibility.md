## Divisibility

Bitcoin is divisible down to **eight decimal places**, meaning a single bitcoin (BTC) can be split into **100,000,000 units**, called *satoshis*. This makes Bitcoin incredibly flexible for both large and micro-scale transactions. You don’t need to own a whole bitcoin to use it — you can send, receive, or save just a few sats. This high level of divisibility ensures Bitcoin can serve both billion-dollar institutions and people buying coffee.

Divisibility also makes Bitcoin more accessible to a global population. As Bitcoin’s value grows, its ability to break down into tiny, usable units allows it to remain practical for daily use, unlike gold or real estate, which are difficult to divide and transport. Whether you're sending $0.05 or $5 million, Bitcoin handles it natively, without needing to "make change" or rely on banks to round values.
