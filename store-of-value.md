## Store of Value

A store of value is an asset that preserves its purchasing power over time, allowing individuals to save wealth without significant loss. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it a strong store of value, especially compared to inflation-prone fiat currencies. Its scarcity, durability, and verifiability reinforce its ability to hold value for the long term.

Many view Bitcoin as “digital gold” because it shares gold’s qualities but is easier to transfer and secure. As adoption grows and supply remains capped, Bitcoin’s role as a reliable store of value becomes more compelling, offering protection against inflation and financial censorship!
