## Fungibility

Fungibility means that **each unit of a currency is interchangeable** — one dollar is equal to any other dollar. In an ideal money, no unit should carry a “history” that makes it more or less acceptable than another. Bitcoin is *technically* fungible at the protocol level — 1 BTC always equals 1 BTC — but in practice, this can be complicated by surveillance and tracking.

Because Bitcoin’s blockchain is public, individual coins can be traced. If a coin was involved in a hack or darknet transaction, some exchanges or services might reject it — treating it as “tainted.” This creates a form of **soft non-fungibility**. However, privacy tools (like CoinJoin) and second-layer solutions (like Lightning) aim to restore fungibility by obfuscating transaction history. True fungibility is crucial for Bitcoin to function as *pure money* — where every unit is treated equally, without prejudice.
